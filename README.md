# Hello, World!
My repository on GitHub.
This is a repository for the game I made (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?).


Instructions


The game consists of 10 questions with 4 possible answers. The complexity of questions (relatively speaking) is increasing from 1 being the easiest and 10 the hardest. Only one answer (a, b, c, or d) for every question is correct. There are 3 different lifelines available during the game that may be used when needed. Each of them can only be used once. If there is an attempt for using a particular lifeline more than once, the game will stop. Lifeline 1 eliminates two possible answers (50 : 50). Lifeline 2 seeks help from the audience (ask the audience). Lifeline 3 calls a person to ask him/her about the question (phone a friend). There are no second chances, and a wrong answer means that the game is over.
